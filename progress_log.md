## 🗓 Week 1 – Foundations
**Focus:** Binary Search, Big-O, Recursion  

**Highlights:**
- Learned how binary search works by halving the array each step.  
- Learned about Big O notation and how run times work for algorithms. 

**Challenges:**
- How to apply Big O notation for bunch of different algorithms.


**Next Week Goals:**
- Start learning sorting algorithms (Quicksort).  
- Implement BFS on graph problems.  
- Solve at least 3 LeetCode medium-difficulty questions.
