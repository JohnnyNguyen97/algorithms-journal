## 🗓 Week 1 – Foundations

**Focus:** Binary Search, Big-O, Selection Sort, Recursion

**Highlights:**

- Learned how binary search works by halving the array each step.
- Learned about Big O notation and how run times work for algorithms.
- Should be starting to try some leetcode question very soon.
- Learned about Selection Sort and got a small recap on arrays and linked lists.
- Selection sort is pretty short and has some use cases.
- Doing leetcode problems. Some are hard some are little easier.

**Challenges:**

- How to apply Big O notation for bunch of different algorithms.
- Still struggling to do leetcode without any form of AI help. NOT AN ISSUE ANYMORE

**Next Week Goals:**

- Start learning sorting algorithms (Quicksort).
- Implement BFS on graph problems.
- Solve at least 3 LeetCode medium-difficulty questions.
